# Bluetooth Nasometer
Cleft lip and palate is the most common major congenital anomaly affecting the head and neck region. Every child born with a cleft palate requires surgery and long-term speech therapy. Despite surgical closure of the cleft and restoration of native palatal anatomy, persistent speech differences in this population remain high. Such differences are typified by nasal air emission and hypernasality, two problems difficult to diagnosis, treat, and monitor. Nasometry is the analysis of nasal air escape through the nose and is measured with a nasometer. Standard nasometers are large, expensive, and uncomfortable for patients, making them less than ideal for routine clinical use. The goal of this proposal is to develop a portable nasometer utilizing Bluetooth technology that integrates with a previously developed speech application.
